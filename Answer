In what ways does GitHub help scientists follow the best practices for scientific computing?

GitHub allows scientists to annotate their work by either including explanations in their code or creating a README file. A README file provides an others a quick tutorial on what the following code is doing, explains the dataset, assumptions, important variables, and the thought process behind the coding, which can be difficult to follow. 
GitHub improves their ability to collaborate with one another by sharing ideas, instructions, and solutions so that others don't fall into the same pitfalls and time-consuming steps. Open-sourced collaboration leads to a wider application of knowledge to different fields that can impact the world of science. 
Branches allow for parallel workspaces that eliminate the fear of tinkering with code by reducing the risk of ruining a master template document. Trying different solutions can lead to marvelous or disasterous results and the only way of knowing the outcome is to try it.
